# Advent of Code 2023

These are my solutions to problems in the Advent of Code 2023.

This year, all solutions are written in Rust, because I am using AoC to practice
the language.

## Running Solutions

To run the solutions, pipe the desired input into the cargo run process:

```bash
$ cat sample.txt | cargo run # Runs sample input
$ cat input.txt | cargo run # Runs actual input
```

If you wish to run part 1, add the `--p1` flag to the cargo process.

```bash
$ cat input.txt | cargo run -- --p1 # Runs part 1
```
